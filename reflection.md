## Reflection

# Self Advice
- use classes and maps from the beginning, I didn't know they existed at the time, but they are perfect
- do more at home, I didn't accomplise as much as I was hoping for
- comment as you go, I did a lot of this, but there were times I got lazy and didn't do that, and they suck
