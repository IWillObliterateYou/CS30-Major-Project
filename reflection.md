## Reflection

# Self Advice
- Use classes and maps from the beginning, I didn't know they existed at the time, but they are perfect
- Do more at home, I didn't accomplise as much as I was hoping for
- Comment as you go, I did a lot of this, but there were times I got lazy and didn't do that, and they suck

# Needs-to-Have
- Sounds. I did not add sound effects, mostly it was because it was the thing that would add the least to the game as far as coding difficulty/complexity, so I left it for at last, which lead to it not being done as I was focused on everything else
- Smooth player movement. I didn't add this for much of the same reasons as the sound effects, although it would add more than the sounds. I also got kind of attached

# Hardest Part
The hardest part was the doors. Attempting to get them to connect to a specific door on another level, then shift levels, it was a nightmare. Eventually I settled on them being a map, one for each level, all constants, five properties each. The screen scroll/adjustments also needed to change along with the levels and location. Additionally I made it so trying to go directly from a door to a door will result in you not going through it, I just thought it felt better, but it sucked to make. 

# Unsolvable
Stupidly, I would say the only thing I failed to make work was my title screen, which for some reason the clickable did not cooperate and would not be usable. Perhaps you could count a problem I had back when this was my 2d array project in the keyPressed, wherein I had to check if the tile ahead was passible in every single if statement, instead of just once, I could never get that to work.
